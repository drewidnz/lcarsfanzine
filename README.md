# lcarsfanzine
As part of the Wellington Zine Fest 2023 fan zine competition, I made a Star Trek the Next Generation fan zine based around an interaction with the LCARS computer terminals from Star Trek the Next Generation, which have a whole distinctive style.
As an addition to the print zine I wanted to have a way people could interact with the LCARS terminal digitally. So the print zine includes an NFC tag people can scan that will open a web page that uses the LCARS style, replicates the contents of the print zine, and provides links to references etc that helped inspire the zine content.
So this project is the online component of the zine.
It uses code provided by https://www.thelcars.com/ and modified by me.
